<p> Steve knows homes. First licensed in 1997, having closed hundreds of transactions and being included in the top 1% of Realtors nationwide, Steve has owned multiple real estate investment companies. For a number of years he owned the largest rehab company in the Pacific Northwest - purchasing in excess of 100 homes each year. He started Utah Housing Cooperative - which quickly became Utah's largest wholesale housing supplier to a large network of rehab companies. Steve has personally purchased more than 600 homes. Whether you are a buyer or a seller, Steve has more experience in real estate than most agents you will ever encounter. Also being a "people person", it doesn't take long to find some common ground with almost everyone he meets. Whether you are buying or selling, you want Steve and his experience in your corner. </p>
